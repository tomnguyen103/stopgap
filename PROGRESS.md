# Stopgap — Build Progress

Single source of truth: `PROJECT_PLAN.md`. This file tracks phase status against the
plan's build table (§13). Out of scope this run: Phase 5 (see `PHASE5-TODO.md`).

## Environment (verified 2026-07-23)

- node v24.15.0 · pnpm 10.34.5 · git 2.54 · Docker 29.6.2 (daemon up) · gh 2.93 (authed)
- Ollama 0.32.3 local; models present: `mistral`, `gemma4:12b`, `gemma4`, `qwen3.6`
- codegraph 0.9.8 · graphify 0.9.19
- **No `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `RESEND_API_KEY` / Langfuse keys in env** → those providers are
  stubbed; local gate + CI run on Ollama (as the plan intends). See `PHASE5-TODO.md`.

## Phase 1 — Spine (weeks 1–2)

**Status:** complete — local gate green, e2e verified. Draft PR
[#1](https://github.com/tomnguyen103/stopgap/pull/1) going ready for CodeRabbit.

**GitHub:** public repo `tomnguyen103/stopgap`; `main` pushed (scaffold baseline);
Actions **disabled** (verified `enabled:false`) per zero-Actions-minutes policy.

Target deliverable: Temporal + Postgres (Drizzle) + live FDA/ASHP/RxNorm polling; AI SDK
provider routing (Gemini + Ollama, health-check failover); one shortage case end-to-end
with mocked activities; Next.js 15 console skeleton. Verified by: Temporal UI shows the
case, console renders it, time-skipped Temporal test proves a multi-week case resumes.

- [x] Monorepo scaffold + local gate wiring (lint+typecheck+test+build, `--if-present`)
- [x] docker-compose (Postgres + Temporal + UI) — running locally
- [x] `@stopgap/db` — Drizzle schema (cases, audit, feed_records) + migrations applied
- [x] `@stopgap/providers` — Gemini+Ollama registry + health-check failover + telemetry sink
- [x] `@stopgap/ingest` — real openFDA/RxNorm clients + fixtures; ASHP client (stubbed w/o key); cross-feed dedupe
- [x] `@stopgap/workflows` — case workflow + mocked activities + time-skip test (4 pass)
- [x] `apps/console` — Next.js 15: case list + hash-chained audit detail page
- [x] `pollFeedsWorkflow` + Temporal Schedule (`start-schedule`, every 15m) — closes the
  "poll → auto-opens case" architecture gap (§4); idempotent via `REJECT_DUPLICATE`
- [x] End-to-end (backend): live openFDA → durable case → Postgres `awaiting_review`, severity `critical`, audit chain intact
- [x] End-to-end (auto-poll): manual `pollFeedsWorkflow` run against live openFDA+ASHP opened
  57 new cases with zero duplicates (pre-existing heparin case correctly skipped)
- [x] End-to-end (UI): heparin case visible in console (list row + detail page), verified in browser against local docker stack

## Phase 2 — Intelligence (weeks 2–4)

**Status:** not started

## Phase 3 — Memory + shadow (weeks 4–6)

**Status:** not started

## Phase 4 — Product (weeks 6–8)

**Status:** not started
